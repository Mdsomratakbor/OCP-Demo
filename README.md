# Open Closed Principle in SOLID

### What is Open Closed Principle in SOLID?

`The Open Closed Principle is one of the SOLID principles defined by Robert C. Martin. The principle says “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”.
So in simple words it says that an implementation (of a class or function), once created, should be closed for further modification, in other words one should not modify an implementation (of a class or function) of logic and/or functionality. One can do refactoring or resolve errors of implementation (of a class or function) but the implementation (of a class or function) is open for extension, in other words one can extend the implementation (of a class or function) of logic and/or functionality.`
